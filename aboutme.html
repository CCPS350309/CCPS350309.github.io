      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am working towards learning how to code to be able to create websites, games, and more to improve the experience for a internet user. Using the internet for many years, there are many things that it can be improved upon. Apart from learning how to code, I have learned how to use image and video editing applications on a computer. I am also learning how computer parts function and what each part does. Perseverance and self-direction is what is needed to achieve success. Being able to continue going despite the obstacles and to organize and do your own work without others telling you what to do will bring success for anyone who follows by those values. In the near-future, I hope to fully learn how to code and to be accepted into college. I also hope to figure out what I want to do as a career by then. Being a kind and hard-working person is what I want to be known for. One can get far in life being such a person.</p>
